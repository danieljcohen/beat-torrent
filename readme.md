## Formatting

1. Install the JavaScript tooling once: `npm install`
2. Run `npm run format` (or `npm run format:check`) to apply Prettier.

Prettier automatically reads `.editorconfig`, so the whitespace rules defined there (LF line endings, trim trailing whitespace, 4-space Python, 2-space HTML/JS, etc.) are enforced whenever you run the formatter or rely on editor integrations.
